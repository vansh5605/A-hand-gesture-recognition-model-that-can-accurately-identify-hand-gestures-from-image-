This project is a real-time hand gesture recognition system using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. It captures webcam video, detects hand landmarks using MediaPipe, and allows the user to label and store different gestures (like "peace", "fist", etc.) by pressing keys. Each gesture is represented by a 63-dimensional feature vector (21 hand landmarks with x, y, z coordinates). The captured data is stored in a file using Python's pickle module for later use. Once enough samples for each gesture are collected, the data can be used to train a machine learning classifier (e.g., Random Forest or SVM) to recognize gestures in real time. This system can form the foundation for gesture-based control in human-computer interaction applications, such as controlling devices or navigating interfaces using only hand signals.
